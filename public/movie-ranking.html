<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>
  This is ony of my favourite movies. I love the confusion , i love not knowing
  what's gonna happen or what is happening even. And i love the concept
</p>

<h3>Nightcrawler</h3>

<p>
  Now this one i also love, it portrays a psycopath perfectly, ready to do
  anything for his goals and not being afraid of the consequences.
</p>

<h3>Expendables</h3>
<p>
  This one is just something else. Having all of your favourite action heroes in
  one movie, what else could you dream of ?!
